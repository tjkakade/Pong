# Pong
A Java functioning implementation of the classic game Pong.

## Description
The game is designed in Java Swing. In order to run, use a compatible IDE (e.g. IntelliJ) and run the "Pong" class, which implements JFrames to display the game. A score tracker is available on screen to track the points each player has scored. 

## Game Play
The game Pong is played with two paddles. This is a two player implementation, so two players can play against each other. Player 1 uses keys "W" and "S" to move the paddle, and Player 2 uses the "UP" and "DOWN" arrow keys. The objective is to hit the ball past the paddle of the opposing player.
